# Autonomous Traffic Manager for Blockchain Networks

## 🚀 Overview
The **Autonomous Traffic Manager** is an AI-powered system designed to optimize blockchain network performance by dynamically adjusting block gas limits, balancing node loads using eBPF, and filtering real-time traffic to prevent spam and DoS attacks.

## 🏗 Tech Stack
- **AI**: PyTorch, TensorFlow (Reinforcement Learning models)
- **Blockchain**: Solidity, Hardhat, Ethereum
- **eBPF**: bcc, libbpf, Cilium (for efficient traffic filtering & load balancing)
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Express.js (if needed)

## 🧠 AI Agent
The AI agent monitors and optimizes blockchain traffic using Reinforcement Learning:
1. **Observes network metrics** (gas fees, transaction volume, congestion levels).
2. **Predicts optimal parameters** (block gas limits, node distribution).
3. **Adjusts network configurations** dynamically.
4. **Uses reward functions** to optimize efficiency and security.

### 🏗 AI Model Training
- **Input**: Blockchain network data (transactions, gas fees, mempool state, node load)
- **Algorithm**: Reinforcement Learning (DQN/PPO)
- **Training Frameworks**: PyTorch / TensorFlow

### ⚡ AI Integration with Blockchain
- Smart contract interacts with AI API for real-time adjustments.
- AI agent sends optimized gas limits & node distribution strategies.

## ⚙️ eBPF Load Balancing & Security
- **Traffic Filtering**: eBPF filters spam/DoS traffic at the kernel level.
- **Node Load Balancing**: Dynamically redistributes transaction load across nodes.
- **Tooling**: Uses `bcc`, `libbpf`, and `Cilium`.
